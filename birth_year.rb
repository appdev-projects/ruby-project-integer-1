# Ask for a person's age (use `gets` to store the user's input), 
# then use the current year today to calculate and display what 
# year they were born in.
# You can (but don't have to) use the Date class to determine the year today.
# Note that we're not taking specific birthdays into account, so the year might be off.
#
# Should output (assuming the current year is 2023):
#
#   "How old are you?"
#   80
#   "Wow, you were born in 1943. You're old!"
#
# Use exactly the same copy ("Wow, you were born...") as above,
# but replace the year with the calculated year.

p "How old are you?"


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# birth_year.rb should output 'Wow, you were born in [<current year> - <input age>]. You're old!'
